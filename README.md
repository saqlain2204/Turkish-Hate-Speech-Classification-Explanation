# Turkish Hate Speech Classification, Explanation & Rewriting 🇹🇷

This project leverages **Multilingual BERT**, **LoRA fine-tuning**, and **SHAP explainability** to **classify, interpret, and rewrite Turkish tweets** that contain hate speech. 
It combines modern NLP tools with transformers and parameter-efficient tuning to handle sensitive content in Turkish social media posts.

## 🔍 Project Description
- **Dataset**: 16k Turkish hate speech tweets classified into hateful (nefret) and not hateful (hiçbiri).
- **Model**: `bert-base-multilingual-cased` with PEFT/LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.
- **Explainability**: SHAP token-level explanations visualize what contributed to hate predictions.
- **Rewriting**: Hateful content is paraphrased using LLaMA-3 to preserve tone but remove offensive phrases.
